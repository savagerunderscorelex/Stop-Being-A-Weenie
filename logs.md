# Logs + Todo

## To Do

- [ ] Design Starting menu with player instructions/keys (wasd, arrows), start button, and options (turning off music or maybe changing music)
- [ ] Figure out how many levels to do
- [ ] Figure out how to update the level ui when finding the collectibles in each level
- [ ] Design each level
- [ ] Figure out hotdog counter thingie (updating the ui when player finds each hot dog)
- [ ] Explain the goal of the game at the cutscene
- [ ] Figure out how to even do cutscenes
- [ ] Figure out how to do the script to change the ui based on current objectives (objectives are probably going to be: find x number of hotdogs, listen to rules, etc )
- [ ] maybe add sound effects on jumping and landing and collecting hot dogs
- [ ] specify game goals a little better
- [ ] 

## Logs

### 10/11

7:33 AM I'm doing logs for this project because I keep forgetting what I did whenever I commit, plus I feel like this project is gonna take me a while.

Scope of the game:

You play as a weiner dog, trying to get little hot dogs throughout multiple levels. Yeah that's it

9:19 AM Added the tileset for the game

5:31 PM Got distracted while writing log: I adjusted the background, added a hotdog coin thingie and had to create the spritesheet (why is it so hard finding assets????? i'm not looking for things that are super specific), added the animation for the coin, coded it to disappear on when the player runs into it, also added the basic basic ui (commit)

10:41 PM Added Autoload, added fraction to level 1 ui node

## 10/12

9:34 AM Changed the objective ui to stay in its own scene and added it separately in the main/level 1 scene, updated autoload variables, added code to make the hotdogs_found label update when collecting hotdogs

9:46 AM Created level 2 scene (not started), created code to change the scene when finding all the hotdogs in level 1
