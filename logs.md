# Logs

## 10/11

7:33 AM I'm doing logs for this project because I keep forgetting what I did whenever I commit, plus I feel like this project is gonna take me a while. 

Scope of the game:

You play as a weiner dog, trying to get little hot dogs throughout multiple levels. Yeah that's it

9:19 AM Added the tileset for the game

5:31 PM Got distracted while writing log: I adjusted the background, added a hotdog coin thingie and had to create the spritesheet (why is it so hard finding assets????? i'm not looking for things that are super specific), added the animation for the coin, coded it to disappear on when the player runs into it, also added the basic basic ui (commit)
